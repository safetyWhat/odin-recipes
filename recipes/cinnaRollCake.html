        <h2>Description:</h2>
    
        <p>
        Our family loves cinnamon rolls.</br></br>
        
        We make them for Christmas. We make them for Father's Day. We make them for Leighton's birthday. We make them because it's Tuesday. We make them because it's raining. We make them to celebrate. We make them just because.</br></br>
        
        We don't need a reason to make cinnamon rolls, really.</br></br>
        
        To be honest, the family is thrilled with any variation of this beloved treat. Bread, muffins, pancakes . . . </br></br>
        Cake.</br></br>
        This cake has been a family favorite for years. Moist yellow cake with sugary cinnamon swirled throughout and topped with a sticky glaze. It's all the deliciousness of cinnamon rolls in a fraction of the time. </br></br>
        
        Tyler picked this cake to celebrate his 6th birthday a couple weeks ago. Each of the kids have looked at this picture as I'm typing this and have asked when I'm making it again. Hmm, maybe I'll throw it together in the morning and call it coffee cake, ha. With a name like that, it's totally acceptable for breakfast, right?</br></br>
        
        If you love cinnamon rolls, you need to make this cake. Then you can have a piece for breakfast, too.
