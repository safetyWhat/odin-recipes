        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Our family loves Chex mix. It's a crunchy snack that has something for everyone. One kid gobbles up the pretzels, another reaches for the mini breadsticks, and they all know to hand Mom the rye chips (unless Dad gets to them first).</p>
        <p>As much as we like the convenience and flavors of the premade bags from the store, we prefer to make it at home. What we lose in convenience, we gain in cost. In just over an hour, we have a big batch of homemade goodness that costs far less than its store-bought counterpart. And it tastes better, too!</p>
        <p>The recipe is very versatile and can easily handle ingredient changes. Cheese crackers, goldfish, mixed nuts, Cheerios, oyster crackers--use whatever you'd like, just have approximately 16 cups of snacks.</p>
        <p>This Chex mix is simple to make, cost effective, and a family favorite!</p>
